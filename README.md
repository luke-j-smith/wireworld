# Wireworld
Wireworld was the first assignment (completed in October 2016) of my Programing in C course. The assignment involved writing a program that would display the progression of a cellular automata, Wireworld. Wireworld is a cellular automation invented by Brian Silverman and is formed from a 2D grid of cells, designed to simulate digital electronics. For the rules please see:

## Assignment
The assignment involved using a text file as input via ```argc``` and ```argv``` and displaying the progression of the circuit. The input file codes empty cells, heads, tails and conductors as ‘ ’, ‘H’, ‘t’ and ‘c’, respectively. The board used for the circuit would always be 40 by 40 cells.

The assignment was split into the following two sections:

#### stdout
Printing the board to the terminal for 1,000 iterations.

#### ncurses
Using ncurses to graphically display 1,000 iterations of the board in the terminal.

## Disclaimer
I have have confirmed with the University that I am able to publish my solution to this assignment. However, as there is the possibility that a similar assignment may still be used by the University, I have been informed that I should state that *this work cannot be used without my permission* and if it is submitted by as current student as their own, they will be investigated for plagiarism.
